### Failures of jaskiratsingh2000
> “If you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original.” - Ken Robinson

Failure:disappointed:is the condiment that gives success its flavor. I think if you couldn't have been attracted by the gravitational pull your chances of checklisting he things could reduce. What I mean by that for people reading this is, I couldn't have achieved anything that sort of unltil I would've put myself in the challenging siutations. My every greatest success:trophy:had been just one step beyond the greatest failure. 

The small instance of my past time when I first stepped into the open source world at the age of 14, It was the year 2014 when I participated for the first time in the [Google Code-In](https://codein.withgoogle.com/archive/) contest. I never knew what open-source and Google Code-In was before when I started but I was more desperate to get “Google Swags”(T-shirt, Hoodie, and Digital Certificate) and avail Google Grand Prize Winner slot in this contest. Commencing from solving more quantity tasks related to designs and documentation category with no prior experience in coding and ended up doing two imitated coding tasks which resulted in a “frozen account” email from GCI Program manager after a few days and disqualification of me from the contest. So, one instance of failure that has taught me well about a valuable lesson that I only gained because of the experience I gathered after messing up.This taught me a good lesson and showed me a better path that has already given me great opportunities to contribute to open source.
